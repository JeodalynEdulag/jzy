1. Create a vector using : operator

a. Sequence from -5 to 5. Write the R code and its output. Describe the output.

```{r, vector = TRUE}
nmbr <- seq(-5,5)
nmbr

```
Describe its output.
It displays the negative and positive numbers, then it displays the 0 in between the negative and positive number.

b. x <- 1:7. What will be the value of x?

```{r, vector = TRUE}
x<- 1:7
x

```
The value of x is numbers form 1 to 7

\hfill\break
2. Create a vector using seq() function

```{r, vector = TRUE}
jd <- seq(1, 3, by= 0.2)
jd


```
Describe the output.

3. A factory has a census of its workers. There are 50 workers in total. The following list shows their ages: 34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29, 35, 31, 27, 22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 43, 53, 41, 51, 35, 24,33, 41, 53, 40, 18, 44, 38, 41, 48, 27, 39, 19, 30, 61, 54, 58, 26, 18.
         
a. Access 3rd element, what is the value?
```{r, vector = TRUE}
age <- c(34,28,22,36,27,18,52,39,42,29,35,31,27,
         22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 43, 53, 41, 51, 35,
         24,33, 41, 53, 40, 18, 44, 38, 41, 48, 27, 39, 19, 30, 61, 54, 58, 26,18)

age[3]

```

b. Access 2nd and 4th element, what are the values?
```{r, vector = TRUE}
age[2]	

age[4]

```

c. Access all but the 1st element is not included. Write the R code and its output.

```{r, vector = TRUE}
age[2:49]

```

\hfill\break
4. Create a vector x <- c("first"=3, "second"=0, "third"=9). Then named the vector,names(x).


```{r, vector = TRUE}
x <- c("first"=3, "second"=0, "third"=9)
names(x)

```
	
a. Print the results. Then access x[c("first", "third")].Describe the output.
	
```{r, vector = TRUE}
x[c("first", "third")]

```
Describe the output. The output in displays two lines on the first line it displays  first and third while on the second line it displays 3 and 9.

\hfill\break
5. Create a sequence x from -3:2.

```{r, vector = TRUE}
x <- c(-3:32)
x

```

a. Modify 2nd element and change it to 0;
	
```{r, vector = TRUE}
x[2] <- 0
x	

```
Describe the output. The -2 output was replaced by zero as a second element.

b. Write the code and its output.
```{r, vector = TRUE}
x[2] <- 0
x	
```
\hfill\break
6.The following data shows the diesel fuel purchased by Mr. Cruz.

a. Create a data frame for month, price per liter (php) and purchase-quantity (liter).

```{r, vector = TRUE}
Month <- c("Jan", "Feb", "March", "Apr", "May", "June")
Month
Price <- c(52.50, 57.25, 60.00, 65.00, 74.25, 54.00)
Price
Quantity <- c(25, 30, 40, 50, 10, 45)  
data_frame <- data.frame(Month, Price, Quantity)
data_frame

```
	
b. What is the average fuel expenditure of Mr. Cruz from Jan to June? 
Note: Use weighted.mean(liter, purchase)

```{r, vector = TRUE}
weighted.mean(Price,Quantity)

```

\hfill\break
7. R has actually lots of built-in datasets. For example, the rivers data “gives the lengths (in miles) of 141 “major” rivers in North America, as compiled by the US Geological Survey”.

```{r, vector = TRUE}
data <- c(length(rivers), sum(rivers), mean(rivers), median(rivers), var(rivers),
sd(rivers), min(rivers), max(rivers))

data
```

\hfill\break
8. The table below gives the 25 most powerful celebrities and their annual pay as ranked by the editions of Forbes magazine and as listed on the Forbes.com website

a. Create vectors according to the above table. Write the codes
```{r, vector = TRUE}
Power_Ranking <- 1:25
Cel_Name <- c("Tom Cruise", "Rolling Stones", "Oprah Winfrey", "U2", 
                   "Tiger Woods", "Steven Spielberg", "Howard Stern", "50 Cent", "Cast of the sopranos",
                   "Dan Brown", "Bruce Springsteen", "Donald Trump", "Muhammad Ali", "Paul McCartney",
                   "George Lucas", "Elton John", "David Letterman", "Phil Mickelson", "J.K Rowling",
                   "Bradd Pitt", "Peter Jackson", "Dr. Phil McGraw", "Jay Lenon", "Celine Dion", "Kobe Bryant")

Pay <- c(67, 90, 225, 110, 90, 332, 302, 41, 52, 88, 55, 44, 55, 40,
         233, 34, 40, 47, 75, 25, 39, 45, 32, 40, 31)

DataRanking <- data.frame(Power_Ranking, Cel_Name, Pay)
DataRanking

```

b. Modify the power ranking and pay of J.K. Rowling. Change power ranking to 15 and pay to 90. Write the codes and its output.

```{r, vector = TRUE}
Power_Ranking [19] <- 15
Power_Ranking
Pay [19] <- 90
Pay

Mag_Ranking <- data.frame(Power_Ranking, Cel_Name, Pay)
Mag_Ranking

```

c. Interpret the data.

```{r, vector = TRUE}
Cel_Pay<- data.frame(Power_Ranking, Cel_Name, Pay)
Cel_Pay
```

J.K.'s pay and power ranking have been changed. Rowling and modified the pay to 90 and the power ranking to 15. As a result, I only changed J.K. Rowling's power ranking of 19 and pay to 75, but I won't change George Lucas' power ranking or pay.
